Bonk is a game inspired by variations of Zonk! but all code, visualizations, and other aspects of the game are solely the property of BonkOffical. The rules are similar to some variations of Zonk! but are unique to Bonk.

Gameplay:

Two teams are chosen (boys and girls). Each team is given a question on their turn, which a team member must answer within two guesses. If a representative of the team is able to guess the correct answer, they can choose up to three of the center 16 buttons to click. Once clicked, there are three possible results:

    Points (awarded at the end of the turn).
    Double! (doubles the amount of points revealed at the end of the turn).
    Bonk! (All points that would normally be awarded during the turn are set to 0 and the turn ends).

Points are then awarded accordingly at the end of the turn. There is a "subtract" button in case teams need motivation to calm down, or in case of mistakes that have been made during the addition process. Whichever team has more points after 10 total questions have been asked is the winner.

In the event that a team cannot answer a question after two attempts, the question goes to the other team, who will also have two attempts at the correct answer. If the other team cannot answer the question, the question continues to alternate teams until a team member gets the answer correct or the game coordinator chooses to pass the question and move on. Should this happen, the team who was first unable to answer the question shall be given the next question.

Other features:

There are three available game modes to choose from: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Choosing any one of these determines the chances of Bonks and Doubles and how often the chances reset.

Clicking the settings panel offers the ability to change the color scheme of the game to the user's liking.
